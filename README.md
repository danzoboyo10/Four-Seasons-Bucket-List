## Getting Started 

Click <a href ="https://four-seasons-bucket-list.herokuapp.com/seasons" target="_blank"/> here </a> to see the deployed app!

## Unsolved Problems
* Button styling issue on all four seaons show pages


## Future Enhancements
- Add Dark / Light mode
- Turn this into a MERN stack application rather than using EJS and having it be a multi-page application
- Fix styling on the four seasons show pages so the edit and delete buttons are inline
